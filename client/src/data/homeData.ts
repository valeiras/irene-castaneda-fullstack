export const presentation = `My research focuses on the study of ecological factors 
that structure communities.In particular, I work on two main biotic processes: predation 
and seed dispersal.Regarding predation, most of my research is focused on the trophic ecology of 
red foxes(Vulpes vulpes) and domestic cats(Felis catus). Concerning seed dispersal, I am interested on 
the role of wild and domestic mammals in seed dispersion of woody species.`;
